# codingChallenges

A personal learning project focused on mastering algorithm implementation in TypeScript while building strong foundations in unit testing with Vitest.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as my practice ground for:

- Algorithm Development: Solving common data structures and algorithm problems in TypeScript.
- Testing Proficiency: Learning and applying unit testing principles, starting with Vitest and gradually progressing to Jest.
- Code Quality: Writing clean, type-safe, and well-tested TypeScript code.

## 🚀 Current Focus

- Implementing fundamental algorithms and data structures
- Building comprehensive test suites using Vitest
- Establishing testing best practices and patterns
- Preparing for transition to Jest in future iterations

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- TypeScript
- Vitest (current testing framework)
- Node.js

## 📈 Learning Path

This project represents my journey from algorithm basics to advanced testing methodologies, creating a solid foundation for professional software development practices.
